        a branch of computer science focused on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception. 
        AI systems learn from large amounts of data and algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions or generate new content without being explicitly programmed for every specific scenario.</p>

        <p>
        The earliest ideas of artificial intelligence appeared long before computers existed. 
        Ancient civilizations created myths about mechanical beings brought to life, reflecting 
        humanity’s early fascination with creating intelligent machines. Philosophers like Aristotle 
        explored the idea of formal logic, laying the groundwork for how modern computers process 
        information. Later, during the 17th and 18th centuries, inventors such as Leibniz and 
        Pascal built early calculating machines that demonstrated how human reasoning could be 
        translated into mechanical processes. These early ideas did not create real AI, but they 
        formed the foundation of mathematical logic and the concept of programmable machines that 
        would eventually make artificial intelligence possible. </p>

        <h2>First AI</h2>
        <div class="text3">
        <p>
        The modern field of artificial intelligence officially began in the 1950s, when researchers 
        first attempted to create machines that could solve problems and think logically. In 1956, 
        a group of scientists at the Dartmouth Conference proposed that human intelligence could be 
        described so precisely that a machine could be made to simulate it. Early AI programs, such 
        as those built by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, could solve mathematical proofs and play 
        simple games like checkers. These systems were limited, but they showed that computers could 
        learn patterns and make decisions. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, AI research grew rapidly, 
        leading to the creation of expert systems—programs designed to mimic the decision-making 
        abilities of human specialists. While early excitement eventually slowed due to technical 
        challenges, these early breakthroughs proved that machine intelligence was possible. </p>

        <h2>Modern Applications</h2>
        <div class="text4">
        <p>
        Today, artificial intelligence plays an essential role in everyday life, often in ways 
        people don’t even notice. Modern AI is powered by machine learning and deep learning, 
        technologies that allow computers to analyze huge amounts of data and improve over time. 
        This has led to major advancements in fields like healthcare, where AI can detect diseases 
        through medical images, and transportation, where self-driving cars use sensors and 
        algorithms to navigate roads. AI also powers voice assistants, recommendation systems on 
        platforms like Netflix and YouTube, fraud detection in banking, and even the development 
        of new scientific discoveries. As AI continues to evolve, it is becoming one of the most 
        transformative technologies of the 21st century, shaping how people work, communicate, 
        and solve complex problems. </p>
